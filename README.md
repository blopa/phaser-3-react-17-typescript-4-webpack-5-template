# Phaser 3 + TypeScript 4 + Webpack 5 + ESLint Starter Kit

This repository contains all the code necessary to start making a game in Phaser 3 using TypeScript 4 and Webpack 5.

## How to Use

You should be able to clone this repository and run `npm run install` to get any of the necessary dependencies.

Once you're done installing, simply run `npm run dev` and the game should begin to run. You'll have to open an internet browser and go to the port that the game is running on (usually `localhost:8080` by default).

Running `npm run dev` runs the game in development mode, which produces larger bundle sizes but compiles faster and provides better debug support. If you desire a smaller game bundle or to host your game on a server, you can use `npm run build` to compile the project into an optimized bundle.
